Ginger Pumpkin Butternut Squash Soup
vegan, makes about 6 cups

1 cup canned organic pumpkin (or use fresh roasted if you have on hand)
4 cups butternut squash cubes
1 Tbsp ginger powder
1/3 cup grade B maple syrup
2 Tbsp vegan buttery spread (add more for a richer, more buttery soup)
1/2 tsp pink sea salt
1/4 tsp cinnamon
4 leaves fresh sage, torn
1/2 cup+ plain soy milk (or other non-dairy milk)

To Make:

1. Add 4 cups of water to a large pot. Bring to boil. Add in butternut squash cubes and a pinch of salt. Boil until squash is tender - but not falling apart.

2. Drain the squash and add to a Vitamix or high speed blender. Add in the pumpkin, spices, and all the remaining ingredients. For the soy, start with 1/2 cup and keep adding until your soup reaches your desired thickness.

3. Blend. Serve immediately - warm. Or you can simmer on the stove until ready to serve. Garnish with fresh sage leaves.
