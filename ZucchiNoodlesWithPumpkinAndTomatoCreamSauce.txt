Instructions

    1. Blend the pumpkin, tomato, cashews, nutmeg, salt to taste, dates, and water together in a high speed blender, along with any other additions you like. Add more water if the sauce is too thick for your taste (I enjoyed mine thick for this recipe).
    2. Dress noodles with the sauce. Add any additional toppings that suit you, and enjoy! Save extra sauce for leftovers, or to use as a veggie dip.
